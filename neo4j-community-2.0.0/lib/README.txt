Neo4j Libraries
=======================================

Neo4j core java libraries. These can be used for embedded development,
but are also required for operation of the server.

Copy them, link them, or include them on the class path, but do **not**
delete them, because that will make the server sad. 

For more information, see the [component documentation](/doc/components.txt)
