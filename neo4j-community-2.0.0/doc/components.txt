Neo4j Components
==================

The included jars in the `lib` directory provide an easy-to-get-going 
distribution of essential components for "embedded programming" a
graph database on the Java Virtual Machine.

Included in this release of Neo4j are:

   neo4j-kernel          the Neo4j graph database engine
   neo4j-lucene-index    index implementation based on Lucene
   neo4j-shell           command shell for browsing and manipulating the graph
   neo4j-graph-algo      graph algorithms (such as shortest path algorithm)
   neo4j-graph-matching  graph matching, matches and returns sub graphs
   neo4j-jmx             exposing information about Neo4j through JMX/management beans
   neo4j-udc             usage data collector
   neo4j-cypher          the Cypher pattern query language
   neo4j-server          Neo4j as a server with a RESTful API

The `lib` directory contains the binary jar files for all components as well as 
required third-party libraries. 

The included usage data collector component will send basic information like     
for example version number to udc.neo4j.org once a day and can easily be disabled,
see more information in the manual:
